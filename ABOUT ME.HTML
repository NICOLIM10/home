The smell of freshly brewed coffee fills my room as I wake up. It’s my morning ritual—a cup of dark, bold coffee to kickstart my day. I’ve got a lot on my plate as a BSIT student at Perpetual Help Molino College, but honestly, I thrive on the hustle.

Classes are intense, especially with coding projects that sometimes feel like puzzles with missing pieces. But I enjoy the challenge—it’s like a race against time, and I love racing. There’s something about the thrill of competition that pushes me to do better, whether it’s behind the wheel or behind a computer screen.

After class, I meet my friends at our favorite café. Hanging out with them keeps me grounded. We chat about everything—school, racing, and our weekend plans. I’m especially excited because there’s a racing event coming up, and I’ve been itching to hit the track.

Later in the evening, I slide into the driver’s seat of my car. The streets are quiet, the kind of calm I love. As I rev the engine, the sound sends a rush of adrenaline through me. Driving at night feels different—like the world is mine to explore. The city lights blur as I speed along the roads, the wind carrying away all my worries.

This is my life—a mix of studying, hanging out, coffee-fueled moments, and the open road. It’s a balance I’ve found, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
